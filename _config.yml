  A computer scientist, researcher, and doctoral student who is working on dialogue systems that utilize social context to handle natural dialogues accurately.
  
  Eren's work focuses on incorporating social norms, conventions, cultures, and practices into dialogue systems. He emphasizes transparency and control in decision-making processes for these systems.

          - Working on socially aware dialogue systems that can utilize social context to interpret user sentences better
          - My work is based on the Social Practice Theory. Social practices are defined as routinized activities that are mediated between participating actors. For example, doctor visits are social practices because they are a type of *routinized activity* that both participating actors (i.e., the doctor and the patient) has certain expectations towards the interaction. These expectations, together with the actors' roles and competences (e.g., the doctor as a role has the competency of diagnosing the patient) provide the necessary handles for the dialogue system to manage the dialogue in such a way that the whole social context can be utilized
          - To this end, I built Budgie. You can find it under **Projects** section
          - I expect to finish my doctoral studies in **this spring**

          - GitHub repository popularity forecasting
          - Maturity calculation and estimation for repositories and developers
          - Topic-tag classification for repositories
          - User matching by matching developers on Twitter, Klout, Stackoverflow using GitHub profile info
          - Repository and developer recommendation system
          - Question and Answering System for product manuals where I used word embeddings to build a system that can rank documents based on the search criteria
          - Set up a state-of-the-art cloud backend system for our searchservice using popular tools such as Kubernetes and Docker
          - Improved the ranking results using ranking algorithms, click graphs, and word embeddings
