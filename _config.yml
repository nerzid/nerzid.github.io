about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  A computer scientist, researcher, and doctoral student who is working on **dialogue systems** that can utilize **social context** to handle natural dialogues accurately.
  
  Eren's work focuses on incorporating social norms, conventions, cultures, and practices into dialogue systems. He emphasizes **transparency** and **control** in decision-making processes for these systems.

        title: Budgie
        sub_title: PhD Project
        link: https://github.com/nerzid/budgie
        description: |
          A socially aware interaction management system that can utilize social context to create scenarios for dialogue and multi-agent systems.
          Users can create scenarios based on the Social Practice Theory.
          The benefit of basing the dialogue system on social practices is that it allows the dialogue system to interpret user actions (i.e., RealActions, see below) instead of intent labels and plan/predict next move based on the extracted actions and the context.
          For example, imagine a scenario where you, as a patient, visit a doctor. This is considered as a social practice since both parties (i.e., the doctor and the patient) have had this sort of interaction before (i.e., the doctor's visit), and therefore they both have certain expectations toward each other and the interaction itself. By building scenarios based on these expectations and the context from the social practice, the dialogue system gain the capability of handling dialogue when unexpected events occur. This is because social practice provide the necessary handles for the dialogue system to utilize.
          A simple example would be that a patient may worry (i.e, an action) and the doctor can calm the patient down (i.e., a competence of being a doctor and an action) since the doctor role is comes with the expectation that the actor who is doctor has the competence of calming down a patient. To calm down the patient, the doctor can use the avaiable options in his toolset to solve the worrying patient problem.

        title: RealActions Extractor
        sub_title: Project
        description: |
          An API for extracting RealActions using **Langchain** for writing prompts systematically, **ChromaDB** for storing the vectorized scenarios, and **Ollama** for serving a local LLM model (i.e., Llama 3.1 8b).
          RealActions are actions such as talking, swimming, requesting information, sharing an object, etc., extracted from utterances. Unlike *intent labels*, they represent what the utterance is trying to convey rather than predicting the interlocutor's intention.
          A publication for RealActions is in progress, and the project will be published on GitHub after submission to a relevant venue.

        description: |
          An online chess game made in Unity3D that allows players to switch seamlessly between 3D and 2D views with a click of a button.
          It featured a custom game mode called Rage Mode, where players were required to capture at least one enemy chess piece every five turns to avoid losing.
          All 3D models were created in Blender.

          - Working on socially aware dialogue systems that can utilize social context to interpret user sentences better
          - My work is based on the Social Practice Theory. Social practices are defined as routinized activities that are mediated between participating actors. For example, doctor visits are social practices because they are a type of *routinized activity* that both participating actors (i.e., the doctor and the patient) has certain expectations towards the interaction. These expectations, together with the actors' roles and competences (e.g., the doctor as a role has the competency of diagnosing the patient) provide the necessary handles for the dialogue system to manage the dialogue in such a way that the whole social context can be utilized
          - To this end, I built Budgie. You can find it under **Projects** section
          - I expect to finish my doctoral studies in **this spring**
